### Introduction

I can introduce myself as a programmer and a game developer. I had a passion for programming and I was hooked. I came into this thinking I knew quite 
a bit when it came to programming. I found out early on that the knowledge I came in with was just tip of the iceberg.  I was always looking for ways 
to improve my skills and I was always looking for ways to learn new things. I have always played video games but looked at it as a hobby. Never did I 
imagined myself as a actual game developer. Now I get to make my hobby a career and with it enter a new world of programming.
